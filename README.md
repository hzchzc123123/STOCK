# Stock Price Forecast Based on Time Series Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is focused on predicting stock prices for the upcoming week using time series analysis. It involves the development of a Python-based model, data processing, and the evaluation of model performance.

## Key Highlights

- **Model Development:** Created predictive models in Python to forecast stock prices, with a focus on a one-week time horizon.

- **Data Processing:** Processed over four years of historical stock price data, incorporating dummy variables to account for the unique impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market behavior.

- **Model Training:** Utilized models including ARIMA and XGBoost to predict stock prices for the upcoming week.
